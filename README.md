## Very First Steps with Programming

Our first steps with coding were issuing simple commands in our terminal when we logged into the OPAL server, like ```ls```, ```cd```,```mkdir```,```rm```.

## Client Side Scripting Demo
Client side scripting means that code is run on the client`s computer. JavaScript is a client scripting language that runs in a browser (which uses the client's computer memory and processor). 

### Create a minimum HTML document:
Use your editor to create this for you, or you can copy and paste this code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Write Demo - JS</title>
</head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>
```

### Set up Script element in the body section

All you have to do to begin coding in JavaScript is to put valid javascipt between open and closing scripts tags:

```
  <body>
```     
```
     <script>

     </script>
```
```
   </body>
```
### Add a document.write method 
*Using document.write method is not recommended for coding, but is is a quick way to show how the it is similar to other programs that use print(Python), or echo(PHP):

<script>
 document.write("Hello World!")
</script>

Now that you have done a document write Method, vi
